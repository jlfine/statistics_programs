## Statistics programs

A repository of programs and notebooks of critical statistical concepts to serve as a source of reference in the development and application of statistical methods to scientific questions, relevant to my current research in computational biology.

- Inductive proof for Boole's inequality
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Simulations to demonstrate Lindley's paradox, contrasting Bayesian and Frequentist schools
- Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm implementation to resolve mixtures of distributions
- Gradient descent to find the minimum of a multivariate function
- Proof of Markov's and Chebyshev's inequalities
